Features, Scenarios, and Stories<a name="TOP"></a>
===================

### 3.1
Using the input/action/output template that I introduced at the beginning of this chapter, describe two features of software that you commonly use,such as an editor or a presentation system.

      One feature in Visual Studio Code is the !+ Enter command. This feature allows people coding in HTML
      to easily set up a template on a document.
      Another feature would be the Inspect Element in any internet explorer. This feature allows users to 
      inspect the network, console, and other data that is being accessed on the web application.

Based on your own experience of school and teachers, write a persona for a high school science teacher who is interested in building simple electronic systems and using them in class teaching.

      Sarah is a physics teacher at New Albany High School. She grew up in New Albany studying physics 
      as well as taking volunteer teaching positions at Hazelwood. Her background in programming consists of 
      the middle school computer lab where she learned to code games like ping pong. Now she is attempting to code
      a demonstration of a physics concept. She is particularly interested in using Python to develop her project 
      because it is a high-level programming language. Sarah believes that this level of programming will enhance
      her teaching experience and provide a better learning tool for her students.

### 3.4
Extend Jack’s scenario, shown in Table 3.5, to include a section in which students record audio reminiscences from their older friends and relatives and include them in the iLearn system. 

      Jack has now included in the iLearn system, a new software that allows students to record and save projects.
      This way, new generations of students can look back on the iLearn website to find past projects that students
      before them have accomplished. This will give these new students a basis for their projects so they do not
      have to start from scratch.

### 3.5
What do you think are the weaknesses of scenarios as a way of envisaging how users might interact with a software system? 

      Scenarios are meant to be less descriptive and more general. For this reason, scenarios can't be a final
      story for a product backlog. The weakness of scenarios would be that the vision of the feature may not
      be exact or even close to what the developer can acheive. These features may have very different 
      implementations than what the scenarios describe. However, scenarios are only meant for a product's
      initial vision, so they can be modified througout. This is the benefit to a scenario. It is not a
      final product vision.

### 3.9
Suggest how a development team might avoid feature creep when “it is” to be in agreement with “a team” faced with many different suggestions for new features to be added to a product.

      To avoid feature creep, developers and users alike should keep their scenarios simple, that way
      future development won't be hindered by additional feature that aren't needed. Product managers
      and the development team should review all possible feature and ask questions like: 
      "Is this functionality going to be used by most users?"
      "Does this feature provide only a specific funtionality, or a general functionality?"
      "Can this feature be added to an existing one, or must it be implemented as a new one?"
      Asking these questions are vital to keeping a simple architecture that is more realistic
      and to avoid "feature creeping".
